### Logical Error in `reverse_string` function

- **File:** `/var/folders/0k/j5165xfd4v17bf5lln5pjh0m0000gn/T/bug_scan_v7qye_e8/python/reverse_string.py`
- **Line Number:** 2-5
- **Description:** The `reverse_string` function fails to reverse a string as intended. The logic currently appends each character of the string `s` in the original order, resulting in the same string being returned.
- **Potential Impact:** This logical error prevents the function from reversing strings and causes incorrect outputs wherever it is used.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  def reverse_string(s):
      reversed_s = ""
      for i in range(len(s)):
          reversed_s += s[i]
      return reversed_s
  ```
````

- **Recommended Fix:**
  - Modify the loop to concatenate characters in reverse order:
  ```python
  def reverse_string(s):
      reversed_s = ""
      for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):  # Iterate from end to start
          reversed_s += s[i]
      return reversed_s
  ```

## Low Priority Issues

- No low priority issues were identified in the current analysis.
